## This is my first Next JS app. 

I Was planning to learn a lot of things but So far did this much. I am planning to make a list of things I learned throught this project.

1. First of All I am just learning about the file structure of Nextjs.
1. I learned about the file based routing system of Nextjs. There are still sonme confusions but I understand the main message.
1. Made a dynamic Routing system In Next js. Which is one of the most inportent thing for frontend development.
1. Did Api Featching alos.

The design is not convensing I know If I get time I will do my best to improve the design.
